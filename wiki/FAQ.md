## Who controls Goldcoin?

Goldcoin is 100% open-source and is controlled by all Goldcoin users around the world. Developers are improving the software but they can’t force a change in the rules of the Goldcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software they use.

In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Goldcoin can only work decently with a complete consensus between all users. Therefore, all users and developers have strong incentives to adopt and protect this consensus.

## Is this Goldcoin’s official website?

No. Goldcoin.org is not Goldcoin’s official website. Just like nobody owns the email technology, nobody owns the Goldcoin network. As such, nobody can speak with authority in the name of Goldcoin.

## What gives Goldcoin value?

Goldcoins have value because they are useful as a form of money. Goldcoin has the characteristics of money (durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability) based on the properties of mathematics rather than relying on physical properties (like gold and silver) or trust in central authorities (like fiat currencies).

In short, Goldcoin is backed by mathematics. With these attributes, all that is required for a form of money to hold value is trust and adoption. In the case of Goldcoin, this can be measured by its growing base of users, merchants, and startups. As with all currency, goldcoin’s value comes only and directly from people willing to accept it as payment.

## Is Goldcoin backed by Gold?

No. It’s impossible to back a cryptocurrency with a precious metal without introducing centralization. Goldcoin is fully decentralized and distributed. Gold was the term used by Satoshi Nakamoto in his whitepaper to describe the inner workings of his invention. Plus it’s a name that means value to every English speaking person on earth.

Goldcoin can be thought of as digital gold with a fixed total supply and mined by computers. Although we think of gold as a store of value, in the past it was used as a medium of exchange and unit of account. This alignment with gold is not trivial as Goldcoin is seeking a return to a monetary “policy” which will allow anyone anywhere in the world to use a single digital currency that will serve all 3 purposes equally well.

## Who Created Goldcoin?

Goldcoin was launched on May 15th, 2013 by an anonymous user on Bitcointalk.org. The original software had several bugs and the coin was ultimately abandoned. In June of 2013, a new team was organized to bring the project back to life. Miners were paid to mine the coin and eventually a heartbeat was found. Since then, the community has grown exponentially with many developers contributing to the project.
